    introduction:
      first_paragraph: "DiehardFund is open source software, built by a worker-owned cooperative social enterprise. We are based in Aotearoa New Zealand, and are part of the"

      heading: Story
      first_paragraph: |
        DiehardFund began in 2011, when activists from Occupy Wall Street and social entrepreneurs from the Enspiral Network realised they needed to solve the same problem: fast, inclusive, effective decision-making without meetings.
        In 2012, we formed our cooperative and released a prototype (DiehardFund Beta). We found that many others around the world needed the same solution.
      second_paragraph: |
        In 2013, we ran a successful international crowdfunding campaign, enabling us to work on a new version of the software, DiehardFund 1.0, which was released the following year.
        In 2015, we raised a round of ethical capital, and are working to bring collaborative decision-making to millions more people around the world.
